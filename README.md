# Team Working
Idea for this project is to create a website that allows user to find other users, invite them to friends list and chat with them.

## Our main goals we want to achieve are:
[1] Allow chat between users
[2] Allow deleting chat history
[3] Allow banning chosen users from chatting with user

## Our optional goals we want to achieve are:
[1] Allow users to Create/Edit profile
[2] Search for other users
[3] Invite users to friends list
[4] Allow Administrators to ban account to chat with anyone
